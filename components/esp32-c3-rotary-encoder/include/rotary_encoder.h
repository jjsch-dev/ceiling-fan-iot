/**
 * @file rotary_encoder.h
 * @brief API definitions for Incremental Rotary Encoder component for ESP32.
 *
 * This component provides a means to interface with a encoders that produce a 
 * quadrature signal on two outputs, which can be used to track position and 
 * direction as movement occurs.
 *
 * To reduce interruptions, from bounces of the mechanical contact to false 
 * triggers due to the lack of a Schmitt trigger in the ESP32, in the idle 
 * state the clock pin has the irq enabled and the data pin does not, when 
 * it detects an falling edge, it toggle the irq enable and activates a timer 
 * which, when it expires, verifies that the clock pin is low and uses the 
 * data pin to set the direction of rotation. 
 * The irq of the clock becomes active when it detects any edge on the data pin, 
 * or there is an error in the decoding of the direction of rotation in the 
 * timer callback.
 * 
 * The notification can be done in three ways: polling using the rotenc_get_state 
 * function, by callback using the rotenc_set_event_callback function, or by 
 * message queue using the rotenc_wait_event function.
 *
